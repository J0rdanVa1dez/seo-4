/* About */
The intent of this component is to automatically set relevent page titles and meta descriptions
based on the content being sent to the view.  It also assists in make pretty urls.

/* Notes */
  * This component is in a very early state.  It probably won't work automatically in your application.
  * Patches for supporting a larger application base are appreciated.

/* Instructions */
  1. Include the component in your app controller:
    var $components = array('Seo');
  
  2. The component will automatically try to pull relevant information for the title/meta description from:
    a. $Controller->data
    b. $Controller->viewVars
    
  3. In your view the meta description is assigned to $meta_description_for_layout.
  
  4. The page title will be $title_for_layout (CakePHP standard);
  
  5. There is also a 2nd class "Seo" which has a static function for creating pretty urls.
     Say you were making a link to view a blog post and you wanted the link to be
     "/post/view/12/this-is-the-blog-post-title" you would create the link:
     $html->link($post['Post']['name'], array('action' => 'view', seo::uri($post['Post'])));
     The url function will automatically pull the id and title from $post and create the link.
  
  6. In your controller you can leave the view function as is "function view($id) { ... }".
     CakePHP will automatically populate the $id and ignore the extra title param.
